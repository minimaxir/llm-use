## System

All code you write must be fully optimized.

## User

Write Python code using the Pillow library to compose 5 images into a single image:

1. The left half consists of one images.
2. The right half consists of the remaining 4 images, equally sized with one quadrant each

## Assistent

Here's an optimized Python script using Pillow to compose 5 images in the specified layout:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def create_composite(left_image_path, right_images_paths, output_path, final_size=(1200, 800)):
    """
    Create a composite image with 5 images:
    - Left half: one large image
    - Right half: 4 equally sized images in quadrants
    
    Args:
        left_image_path (str): Path to the image for the left half
        right_images_paths (list): List of 4 paths for the right quadrant images
        output_path (str): Path where the final composite will be saved
        final_size (tuple): Final dimensions of the composite image (width, height)
    """
    
    # Create a new blank image with white background
    composite = Image.new('RGB', final_size, 'white')
    
    # Calculate dimensions
    half_width = final_size[0] // 2
    half_height = final_size[1] // 2
    
    try:
        # Process left image
        left_img = Image.open(left_image_path)
        # Resize maintaining aspect ratio
        left_img.thumbnail((half_width, final_size[1]))
        # Paste left image
        composite.paste(left_img, (0, 0))
        
        # Process right quadrant images
        quadrant_positions = [
            (half_width, 0),              # top-left
            (half_width + half_width//2, 0),  # top-right
            (half_width, half_height),        # bottom-left
            (half_width + half_width//2, half_height)   # bottom-right
        ]
        
        for img_path, position in zip(right_images_paths, quadrant_positions):
            # Open and process each quadrant image
            with Image.open(img_path) as img:
                # Resize maintaining aspect ratio
                img.thumbnail((half_width//2, half_height))
                # Paste into position
                composite.paste(img, position)
        
        # Save the final composite
        composite.save(output_path, quality=95, optimize=True)
        print(f"Composite image saved successfully to {output_path}")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating composite: {str(e)}")
        raise

def main():
    # Example usage
    left_image = "path/to/left_image.jpg"
    right_images = [
        "path/to/top_left.jpg",
        "path/to/top_right.jpg",
        "path/to/bottom_left.jpg",
        "path/to/bottom_right.jpg"
    ]
    output_path = "output_composite.jpg"
    
    # Verify all input files exist
    all_images = [left_image] + right_images
    missing_files = [f for f in all_images if not os.path.exists(f)]
    
    if missing_files:
        print("Error: The following files are missing:")
        for f in missing_files:
            print(f"- {f}")
        return
    
    # Create the composite
    create_composite(left_image, right_images, output_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code is optimized in several ways:

1. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Uses context managers (`with` statements) for automatically closing images
   - Processes one image at a time
   - Doesn't keep unnecessary copies in memory

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Uses `thumbnail()` for efficient resizing while maintaining aspect ratio
   - Optimizes the final JPEG output using the `optimize=True` parameter
   - Calculates positions once and stores them in a list

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Includes comprehensive error checking
   - Verifies input files exist before processing
   - Provides meaningful error messages

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Allows customization of final image size
   - Maintains aspect ratios of original images
   - Easily modifiable for different layouts

To use this code:

1. Import the required Pillow library (`pip install Pillow` if not installed)
2. Replace the image paths in the `main()` function with your actual image paths
3. Run the script

The script will create a composite image where:
- The left half is occupied by one large image
- The right half is divided into four equal quadrants, each containing one of the remaining images
- All images are resized proportionally to fit their designated spaces
- The final composite is saved as a high-quality JPEG

The final output will be an optimized JPEG image with the specified layout. The default size is 1200x800 pixels, but you can modify this by passing different dimensions to the `create_composite` function.
